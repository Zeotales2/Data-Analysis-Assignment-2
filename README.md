# Data-Analysis-Assignment-2
This project involves data collection, cleaning, visualization, and model evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib,

Dependent Variable: accident_severity (what we predict)
Independent Variables: weather, road_condition, vehicle_speed, light_condition
Model Meaning: It estimates how changes in these conditions affect accident severity.
Usefulness:
Can identify dangerous combinations (e.g., rain + poor lighting + high speed).
Helps authorities plan road safety campaigns.
Useful for developing countries to reduce accident rates through data-driven insights.
